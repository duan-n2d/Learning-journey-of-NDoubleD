## Learning Philosophy

I believe in learning by **building real projects** and **documenting the process**. This repository represents my commitment to:

1. **Structured learning** - Following a deliberate path through each technology
2. **Practical application** - Applying concepts to solve actual problems
3. **Knowledge sharing** - Documenting challenges and solutions for myself and others
4. **Interdisciplinary connections** - Exploring how data and web technologies complement each other
